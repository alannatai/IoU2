## About

Welcome to the webapp that allows people to keep track of their expenses and save time calculating how much money to pay one another.

## Home Page

## My Households

When you click on "My Households" tab at the top, you will be able to view all the households that you are apart of.

This webapp isn't neccessarily only for households, it can used for however you like, for example if you want to keep track of splitting money for a trip or other ways, you can also create a "household" with you and other members.

## Edit Household

Once you click into your household, you will have an option to edit your household where you can change the name of the household or removing members. The admin/superuser will not be able to remove themselves off the household, they would have to delete the whole household.

## Add Expense

When you buy an expense, you can click on "ADD EXPENSE" button where you will be prompted to enter the name of the expense, cost and description.

## Keeping Track Of Who Owes You Money

Once that is submitted, the cost of the expense will be split evenly to all the other household members and it will show how much money each person owes you(as you can see on the right side of the page).

Once the balance is no longer negative, it means that person no longer owes you anything and you can click on "PAID" to keep track. If you were added to the household later, the expense from previously will not be added to your total.

## Next Steps

Next steps, we would like to add a function where household members can split their chores as well. We would also like to connect this webapp to paypal where the household members will be able to send money for the expenses through our webapp.
