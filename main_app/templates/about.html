<h2><strong>Welcome to IOU&#178;!</strong></h2>
<h5>We are eliminating awkward conversations about who owes who. No more tit for tat.</h5><br>

<hr>
<p>And just so you know, this webapp isn't just for households; it can used however you like!</p>
<p>For example, if you want to keep track of splitting money for a trip or other ways, you can also create a "household" with you and other members.</p><hr/>

<h4>Let's get started and walk you through how to use the app.</h4>


<h5><u>My Households</u></h5>
<p>When you click on "My Households" tab at the top, you will be able to view all the households that you are a part of. Create a new household if this is your first time around.</p>

<h5><u>Edit Household</u></h5>
<p>Once you've created your household, you can now edit your household. Here is where you can add other members to your household. Please note: the creator of the household cannot be removed from it.</p>

<h5><u>Add Expenses</u></h5>
<p>When you incur an expense, such as an electricity bill or even your monthly rent, you can use "ADD EXPENSE" to enter that expense to the household.</p>

<h5><u>Keeping Track Of Who Owes You Money</u></h5>
<p>Once your household is created and you've listed an expense, you will see the expense's cost split on the right side of the page.</p>

<p>As more expenses are added by other users, the ledger will calculate how much everyone is owed, based on who paid for the expense and who is still oweing on it.</p>

<p>Once one of your household members has paid up on the expense, you can click on "MARK AS PAID" to remove them from the split.</p>
